supraudit is FREE for personal use, and/or up to 5 hosts. If you are going to use this in a commercial environment of 10+ hosts, you'll need to talk to products@technologeeks.com about licensing - and you probably want to get the PRO version anyway, which contains the server (for -R message relaying) and, soon the GUI.

If you suggest an improvement or fix which I will incorporate, you get a free site license for life, and my thanks.
